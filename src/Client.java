/*
TO EDIT
The Client class reads all the transactions from a file (transaction.txt) and
saves them in an array (transaction[]). A transaction is implemented by the
Transactions.class.
Using the send() method of Network class the client transfers the transactions
to the network input buffer and it yields the cpu in case the network input buffer
is full.
Also, using the receive() method of Network class the client retrieves the
updated transactions from the network output buffer and yields the cpu in case
the buffer is empty. Each updated transaction received is displayed immediately
on the screen.
