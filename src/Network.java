/*
The Network class provides the infrastructure to allow the client and the
server to process the transactions.

The client and the server need to be connected
(using connect()) to the network prior to an exchange.

The Network class also implements an input buffer (inComingPacket[]) and an output buffer
(outGoingPacket[]) to respectively receive transactions from the client and to
return updated transactions to the client.

The capacity of these buffers are 10 elements, so the network indicates whether they are full or empty
