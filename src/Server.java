/*
TO EDIT
The Server class reads all the accounts from a file (account.txt) and saves
them in an array (account[]). An account is implemented by the Accounts class.
Using the transferrIn() method of Network class the server retrieves the
transactions from the network input buffer and performs the operations
(withdraw, deposit, query) on the specific accounts. It yields the cpu in case the
buffer is empty.
Each updated transaction is transmitted to the network output buffer using the
transferOut( ) method of Network class and the server yields the cpu in case the
buffer is full.
