When the maxNumber of packets is 10, it's slightly slower. It has the following run times. It's between 23-27 ms for server, and 13-16 for client.

client sending thread - Running time 15 milliseconds
client receiving thread - Running time 16 milliseconds
server thread -  Running time 27 milliseconds
__
client sending thread - Running time 13 milliseconds
client receiving thread - Running time 14 milliseconds
server thread -  Running time 23 milliseconds

client sending thread - Running time 14 milliseconds
client receiving thread - Running time 14 milliseconds
server thread -  Running time 24 milliseconds

When the maxNumber of packets is 20, it's slightly faster. It has the following run times. It's between 19-23 ms for server, and 9-14 for client :

client receiving thread - Running time 14 milliseconds
client sending thread - Running time 12 milliseconds
server thread -  Running time 23 milliseconds
__
client receiving thread - Running time 10 milliseconds
client sending thread - Running time 9 milliseconds
server thread -  Running time 19 milliseconds
__
client receiving thread - Running time 12 milliseconds
client sending thread - Running time 11 milliseconds
server thread -  Running time 22 milliseconds

Sometimes, they slightly overlap, when we aren't lucky for example.
